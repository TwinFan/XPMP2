/// @note       This file bases on and should be largely compile-compatible to
///             the header provided with the original libxplanemp.
/// @note       Some functions are marked deprecated, reason is given with
///             each function. They are only provided for backward

/// @details    This is one of two main header files for using XPMP2.
///             (The other is `XPMPAircraft.h`).
///             XPMP2 is a library allowing an X-Plane plugin to have
///             planes rendered in X-Plane's 3D world based on OBJ8
///             CSL models, which need to be installed separately.
///             The plugin shall subclass XPMP2::Aircraft and override
///             the abstract virtual function XPMP2::Aircraft::UpdatePosition()
///             to provide updated position and attitude information.
///             XPMP2 takes care of reading and initializaing CSL models,
///             instanciating and updating the aircraft objects in X-Plane,
///             display in a map layer, provisioning information via X-Plane's
///             TCAS targets and AI/multiplayer (and more) dataRefs.
