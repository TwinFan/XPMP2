/// @brief      Handling the `related.txt` file for creating groups of similar looking aircraft types,
///             and Doc8643, the official list of ICAO aircraft type codes.
/// @details    A related group is declared simply by a line of ICAO a/c type codes read from the file.
///             Internally, the group is just identified by its line number in `related.txt`.
///             So the group "44" might be "A306 A30B A310", the Airbus A300 series.
/// @details    Doc8643 is a list of information maintained by the ICAO
///             to list all registered aircraft types. Each type designator can appear multiple times
///             in the dataset for slightly differing models, but the classification und the WTC
///             will be the same in all those listing.\n
///             XPMP2 is only interested in type designator, classification, and WTC.
